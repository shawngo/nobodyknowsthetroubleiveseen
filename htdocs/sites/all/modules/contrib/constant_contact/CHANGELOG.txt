RC1 CHANGES
---------------
Account edit page now checks if the user is registered with constant contact and automatically checks the checkbox if the user email is found and they are set to active status, this will mean people who signed up using a different method (through the block method for example) will be correctly flagged as subscribed.

The duplicated newsletter section which appears when you have other account page tabs has been removed.

The newsletter section on the account edit page is now expanded by default.

The account edit page custom fields has been fixed, these should work correctly now and update the extra fields with constant contact when they appear within a new tab.

See http://drupal.org/node/671666 for reference to these bugs.
